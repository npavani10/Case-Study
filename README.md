This project focuses on optimizing the room mix strategy for LUX* Resorts & Hotels to achieve their financial goals. Using Excel's powerful analytical tools, the study employs a linear programming model to determine the optimal allocation of rooms across different hotels and seasons. The objective is to meet the â‚¬38 million EBITA target from foreign guests while maximizing revenue from local guests. Excel's Solver function plays a crucial role in calculating the optimal solutions by considering various constraints and assumptions, ultimately aiding in effective decision-making for the hotel chain.
